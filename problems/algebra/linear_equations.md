## Problem 1: Basic Linear Equation

If **3x + 7 = 22**, what is the value of **x**?

**A)** 3  
**B)** 5  
**C)** 7  
**D)** 9

### 📝 Solution

**Step 1:** Subtract 7 from both sides
```
3x + 7 = 22
3x = 22 - 7
3x = 15
```

**Step 2:** Divide both sides by 3
```
x = 15 ÷ 3
x = 5
```

**✅ Answer: B) 5**

## Problem 2: Linear Equation with Fractions

If **(2x/3) + 4 = 10**, what is the value of **x**?

**A)** 6  
**B)** 9  
**C)** 12  
**D)** 15

### 📝 Solution

**Step 1:** Subtract 4 from both sides
```
(2x/3) + 4 = 10
2x/3 = 6
```

```
2x = 18
```

**Step 3:** Divide by 2
```
x = 9
```

**✅ Answer: B) 9**
